Failed to compile resources with the following parameters:
 -bootclasspath "/Users/ines/Development/android-sdk-macosx/platforms/android-21/android.jar" -d "/Users/ines/Documents/Game/Temp/StagingArea/bin/classes" -source 1.6 -target 1.6 -encoding UTF-8 "com/Company/Game/R.java" "com/facebook/android/R.java"
 warning: java/lang/Object.class(java/lang:Object.class): major version 51 is newer than 50, the highest major version supported by this compiler.
 It is recommended that the compiler be upgraded.




 Steps to make this work:

 Set the JAVA_HOME environment value:

 export JAVA_HOME= ` /usr/libexec/java_home `

 Add the java bin folder to the PATH variable:

 export PATH=$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH

 Create a link in the following directory:

 sudo ln -nsf /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.7.0_45.jdk/Contents \ /System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Versions/CurrentJDK

 And that's it. Hope it helps.
